Follow these steps to edit the contents of a Smart Object:

    In your document, select the Smart Object layer in the Layers panel.

    Choose Layer?Smart Objects?Edit Contents.
    Or you can simply double-click the Smart Objects layer thumbnail in the Layers panel.

    A dialog box appears, telling you to save your changes and save the file in the same location.

    Click OK to close the dialog box.
    The Smart Object opens in the program in which it was created, either Illustrator or Photoshop.

    Edit your file:

    Choose File?Save to incorporate the edits.

    Close your source file.

    Return to your Photoshop document, which contains your Smart Object.
    If all goes as expected, all instances of the Smart Object are updated.
